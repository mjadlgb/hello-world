GitHub tour

I'm mjadlgb - a web code hobbyist wanting to go pro and dive into the development industry. I like snowboarding, reading, beer and gaming.

I've joined GitHub to turn my HTML, CSS, JavaScript hobby into proper front-end web development. I'm really interested in mastering Node.js, Angular.js, React.js and more. It's also on my agenda to be a ninja on all things SASS and PHP.
